# NOAA Wind Profiler

---

## üîí Why Source Directly from NOAA?

For operations requiring atmospheric wind data, it may be advantageous to source forecasts directly from official U.S. government models such as HRRR, RAP, or GFS provided by NOAA, rather than relying on third-party public websites like the Mark Schulze wind profiler. While both methods involve retrieving data over the internet, using government-hosted sources may offer greater reliability and reduce exposure to unvetted external platforms. Additionally, once the data is downloaded, it can be processed locally without further internet access, enabling offline use in communications-restricted environments. This approach may enhance operational resilience and data integrity in tactical or field applications.

### üîê Enhanced Security Through Global Data Processing

**Local Location Processing:**
Unlike web-based wind profilers that send your specific coordinates to external servers, this tool downloads **complete global weather data** and processes your location information entirely on your local device. This approach provides several security advantages:

- **No Location Tracking**: Your exact coordinates are never transmitted to external servers
- **No Query Logs**: External services cannot log your location requests or usage patterns
- **Offline Capability**: Once downloaded, wind profiles can be generated without internet access
- **Operational Security**: Ideal for tactical operations where location privacy is critical

**How It Works:**
1. **Global Download**: Downloads complete weather data for the entire Earth (GFS) or continental region (HRRR/RAP)
2. **Local Processing**: Your device extracts and interpolates wind data for your specific location
3. **No External Queries**: No need to send coordinates to third-party services
4. **Cached Data**: Downloaded files can be reused for multiple locations without additional downloads

**Security Benefits:**
- **Location Privacy**: Your coordinates never leave your device
- **Usage Anonymity**: No external service can track your wind profiling activities
- **Reduced Digital Footprint**: Minimizes exposure to potential surveillance or tracking
- **Tactical Advantage**: Enables wind analysis in communications-restricted environments

This approach is particularly valuable for aviation, military operations, research, and any application where location privacy and operational security are priorities.

## üìä File Sizes & Data Coverage

### Why Are the Files So Large?

The NOAA weather model files are massive because they contain **complete 3D snapshots of the entire atmosphere** at specific forecast times. Here's what makes them so large:

#### **Data Coverage by Model:**

**HRRR (High-Resolution Rapid Refresh):**
- **Coverage Area:** Continental United States only
- **Grid Size:** 1059 √ó 1059 = ~1.1 million grid points
- **Horizontal Resolution:** 3km (very high resolution)
- **File Size:** ~130-140 MB
- **Coverage:** ~10 million square kilometers

**RAP (Rapid Refresh):**
- **Coverage Area:** Continental United States
- **Grid Size:** 337 √ó 337 = ~114,000 grid points  
- **Horizontal Resolution:** 13km
- **File Size:** ~17-20 MB
- **Coverage:** ~10 million square kilometers

**GFS (Global Forecast System):**
- **Coverage Area:** **Entire Earth** (every square kilometer of the planet)
- **Grid Size:** 721 √ó 1440 = ~1.04 million grid points
- **Horizontal Resolution:** 25km
- **File Size:** ~520 MB
- **Coverage:** ~510 million square kilometers (entire Earth's surface)

#### **What's Inside Each File:**

Each file contains multiple meteorological variables at multiple pressure levels:

**Primary Variables (what we extract):**
- **`u`** - Eastward wind component (m/s)
- **`v`** - Northward wind component (m/s)

**Additional Variables (not used by our script):**
- **`gh`** - Geopotential height (geopotential meters)
- **`t`** - Temperature (Kelvin)
- **`dpt`** - Dew point temperature (Kelvin)
- **`wz`** - Vertical velocity (Pa/s)

**Pressure Levels:**
- **HRRR:** 7 levels (1000, 925, 850, 700, 500, 300, 250 hPa)
- **RAP:** Similar levels
- **GFS:** More comprehensive levels, goes higher in altitude

#### **Why We Need the Full Files:**

Even though we only extract wind data for one location, NOAA doesn't provide "point downloads." The wind components are distributed throughout the file at different pressure levels, so we need the complete 3D atmospheric state to interpolate wind data to any altitude.

**Think of it like this:** When you download GFS data for a wind profile in Berlin, you're actually downloading a complete snapshot of the world's weather at that moment - you're just extracting the wind data for that one specific location from the massive global dataset!

## üêç Environment Setup

### Recommended: Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python projects:

**Using venv (Python 3.3+):**
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv wind_env

# Activate virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source wind_env/bin/activate
# On Windows:
wind_env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Using conda:**
```bash
# Create conda environment
conda create -n wind_env python=3.11

# Activate environment
conda activate wind_env

# Install dependencies
conda install -c conda-forge cfgrib xarray pandas numpy scipy
```

### Environment Verification

After setting up your environment, verify the installation:

```bash
# Check Python version
python --version

# Check installed packages
pip list | grep -E "(cfgrib|xarray|pandas|numpy|scipy)"

# Test import
python -c "import cfgrib, xarray, pandas, numpy, scipy; print('All packages imported successfully!')"
```

```

### Auto Mode

The **Auto mode** is recommended for most users as it:
- Automatically checks all available models (HRRR, RAP, GFS)
- Selects the model with the most current valid forecast
- Ensures you get the freshest available data
- Handles model availability issues gracefully

### Forecast Hours Selection

The script allows you to select forecast hours for more detailed analysis:

- **HRRR Model**: 0 to 18 hours (hourly intervals)
- **RAP Model**: 0 to 21 hours (hourly intervals)  
- **GFS Model**: 0 to 384 hours (6-hour intervals for longer forecasts)

```
Enter forecast hour: 0
```

- **0-hour**: Current analysis (most accurate for current conditions)
- **1-hour**: 1-hour forecast
- **6-hour**: 6-hour forecast
- And so on...

### File Caching

The script automatically caches downloaded files and asks whether to use cached or fresh data:

```
Found cached file: hrrr.t03z.wrfsfcf01.grib2
File age: 5 minutes ago
File size: 134.9 MB
Use cached file or download fresh? (c/d): c
```

- **Cached files**: Faster execution, no re-download needed
- **Fresh files**: Ensures latest data, but requires download time
- **File age**: Shows when the cached file was downloaded
- **File size**: Helps verify data integrity

### Data Export

Results can be saved to both CSV and human-readable text files:

```

## üîß How It Works

1. **Location Analysis**: Determines if location is within CONUS for model selection
2. **Model Selection**: Chooses appropriate weather model (HRRR/RAP/GFS/Auto)
3. **Data Source**: Downloads latest forecast from NOAA NOMADS servers
4. **File Format**: Processes .grib2 files using cfgrib library
5. **Wind Components**: Extracts U (eastward) and V (northward) wind components
6. **Calculations**: Converts to wind speed and direction using meteorological formulas
7. **Altitude Conversion**: Maps pressure levels to altitude using International Standard Atmosphere (ISA)
8. **Interpolation**: Smoothly interpolates wind data to 1,000-foot intervals
9. **Output**: Displays results in a clean, tabular format with Zulu time

**Security Note**: All location processing occurs locally on your device. Your coordinates are never transmitted to external servers - the tool downloads complete global/regional weather data and extracts your specific location's wind profile locally.

## üìä Data Accuracy & Limitations

### Interpolation Quality

- **Linear Interpolation**: Uses linear interpolation between pressure levels, which is standard practice in meteorology
- **Altitude Conversion**: Based on International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) model, which assumes standard atmospheric conditions
- **Grid Resolution**: 
  - HRRR: 3km resolution (highest detail)
  - RAP: 13km resolution (medium detail)
  - GFS: 25km resolution (global coverage)
- **Update Frequency**: 
  - HRRR: Every hour
  - RAP: Every hour
  - GFS: Every 6 hours

### Known Limitations

- **Atmospheric Variations**: ISA model may not perfectly match actual atmospheric conditions
- **Terrain Effects**: Model doesn't account for local terrain influences on wind patterns
- **Temporal Resolution**: Limited to model output times (not real-time)
- **Ocean vs Land**: Data quality may vary over oceans vs. land areas
- **Extreme Weather**: Accuracy may decrease during severe weather events

### Best Practices

- **Current Conditions**: Use 0-hour forecast for most accurate current conditions
- **Short-term Planning**: Use 1-6 hour forecasts for near-term planning
- **Auto Mode**: Use Auto mode for best model selection
- **Verification**: Compare with local observations when available
- **Multiple Sources**: Consider using multiple forecast hours for trend analysis

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Usage

### Command Line Options

For automated or batch processing, you can modify the script to accept command line arguments:

```python
# Example: Add to the top of wind_profiler.py
import sys

if len(sys.argv) >= 4:
    lat = float(sys.argv[1])
    lon = float(sys.argv[2])
    max_elevation = int(sys.argv[3])
    forecast_hour = int(sys.argv[4]) if len(sys.argv) > 4 else 0
    # Use these values instead of prompting
```

### Batch Processing

Create a script to process multiple locations:

```python
locations = [
    (32.22, -110.94, 20000),  # Tucson
    (52.52, 13.41, 15000),    # Berlin
    (21.31, -157.86, 25000),  # Honolulu
]

for lat, lon, max_elev in locations:
    # Process each location
    print(f"Processing {lat}, {lon}")
    # ... wind calculation code
```

### Data Analysis

The interpolated data can be used for:

- **Wind Shear Analysis**: Calculate wind shear between altitude levels
- **Trend Analysis**: Compare multiple forecast hours
- **Statistical Analysis**: Process multiple locations or time periods
- **Visualization**: Create wind profile plots using matplotlib

## ü™Å How Are Winds Calculated Every 1,000 Feet?

- **Raw Data:** All models provide wind data at specific pressure levels (e.g., 1000 hPa, 925 hPa, 850 hPa, etc.), not at fixed altitude intervals.
- **Pressure-to-Altitude Conversion:** The script uses the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) model to convert each pressure level to its corresponding altitude in feet.
- **Wind Components:** For each pressure level, the script extracts the U (east-west) and V (north-south) wind components, then calculates wind speed and direction.
- **Interpolation:**
  - The script creates a regular grid of altitudes from 0 to your specified maximum elevation in 1,000-foot increments.
  - It uses linear interpolation (via `scipy.interpolate.interp1d`) to estimate wind speed and direction at each 1,000-foot level, based on the values at the original pressure levels.
- **Result:**
  - You get a smooth, regularly spaced wind profile (every 1,000 feet) that is easy to read and use for aviation, ballooning, UAVs, and more.
